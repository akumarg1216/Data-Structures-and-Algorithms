Bubble Sort: 

1. is the sorting technique

2. for n elements to be sorted there will be n-1 rounds of iteration

3. After each iteration the largest element will be in its correct position.

4. Similarly for n-1 rounds all the elements will be in their correct position & one element left will be in its correct position by default.

5. i will start from 1 and go till <n.

6. After each iteration since the last element gets sorted so the iteration goes only till n-i element since the last ith elements are already sorted.

7. Time Complexity: O(n^2)

8. Best Time Complexity: O(n) // if the array is already sorted.

9. Worst Time Complexity: O(n^2) // if the array is reverse sorted.

10. Space Complexity: O(1) // no extra space required.

11. Bubble Sort Algorithm is: Stable Algorithm.
