* In merge sort we apply the divide & conquer policy.

* The mid is found using (start + end)/2.

* The array is broken into 2 parts. Again in both parts, the array is divided from mid.

* This process continues recursively till only a single element is left.

* After that the parts are joined together but in a sorted manner.

* Joining two smaller sorted arrays to form the original size sorted array.

* This method uses recursion.

* The merge sort is the fastest sorting technique among the Bubble, Selection & the Insertion sort technique.

* Worst Time Complexity:

* Best Time Complexity:

* Space Complexity: O(n)
