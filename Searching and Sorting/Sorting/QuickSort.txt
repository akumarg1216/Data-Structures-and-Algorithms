* Quick Sort algorithm is a sorting technique in which the element is taken as pivot and firstly placed in it's right position.

* We then check the left part of the pivot; which should be less than the pivot element.

* Similarly, the right part of the pivot should be elements greater than pivot.

* QuickSort uses partitioning + recursion to sort the problem statement.

* Best Time Complexity: O(n log n)

* Average Time Complexity: O(n log n)

* Worst Time Complexity: O(n^2)

* Space Complexity: O(n)

* Optimized Space Complexity: O(n log n)

* Stable: The default implementation is not stable. However any sorting algorithm can be made stable by considering indexes as comparison parameter. 

* In-place: Yes (because it uses extra space only for storing recursive function calls but not for manipulating the input)
