* Note: Insertion Sort uses shifting & not swapping

* Rounds = Number of element - 1

* Time Complexity: O(n^2)

* Best Time Complexity: O(n)

* Space Complexity: O(1)

* In insertion sort we take an element and consider that to be sorted.

* The next element if smaller than that single element is placed to the left or to the right if it is greater.

* The process continues and the starting i elements get sorted in each round.
